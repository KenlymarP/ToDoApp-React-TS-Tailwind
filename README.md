## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS] (https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TypeScritp](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - is JavaScript with added syntax for types
- [DND Kit](https://dndkit.com/) - For Drag and Drop

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I learned to use the CSS styles provided by Tailwind, to type functions, create interfaces, types. Using useState, useEffect, Context. On the other hand to create my own hooks and pass typed Props. Also drag and drop with the dnd-kit library.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own learnings.**
